      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is TypeScript and what problems does it solve?",
      "answer": "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. Benefits: 1) Catches errors at compile-time, 2) Better IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring), 3) Improved code documentation, 4) Easier refactoring in large codebases, 5) Enhanced OOP features (interfaces, generics).",

    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between 'interface' and 'type' in TypeScript.",
      "answer": "Both define types, but: INTERFACE - Can be extended/merged, better for object shapes, more readable errors. TYPE - Can represent unions, intersections, primitives, tuples. Use interface for objects/classes, type for unions/complex types. Example: type ID = string | number; interface User { id: ID; name: string; }",

    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What are TypeScript Generics and why are they useful?",
      "answer": "Generics allow writing reusable code that works with multiple types. Example: function identity<T>(arg: T): T { return arg; } Benefits: 1) Type safety without duplication, 2) Code reusability, 3) Better than 'any' type. Common in arrays: Array<T>, Promise<T>.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "tags": ["generics", "advanced"]
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is 'unknown' type and how is it different from 'any'?",
      "answer": "'unknown' is type-safe version of 'any'. With 'any', you can do anything (no checks). With 'unknown', you must narrow the type before use (type guards). Example: let val: unknown; if (typeof val === 'string') { val.toUpperCase(); } Use 'unknown' instead of 'any' for better safety.",

      "tags": ["types", "safety"]
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What are TypeScript utility types? Give examples.",
      "answer": "Utility types transform existing types. Common ones: 1) Partial<T> - makes all properties optional, 2) Required<T> - makes all required, 3) Pick<T, K> - selects specific properties, 4) Omit<T, K> - excludes properties, 5) Record<K, T> - creates object type. Example: Partial<User> allows all User fields to be optional.",

      "tags": ["utility-types", "advanced"]
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Explain TypeScript's 'never' type and when to use it.",
      "answer": "'never' represents values that never occur. Uses: 1) Functions that never return (throw errors, infinite loops), 2) Exhaustive type checking, 3) Unreachable code. Example: function error(msg: string): never { throw new Error(msg); } Also used in conditional types to filter out unwanted cases.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "tags": ["types", "advanced"]
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is type narrowing in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Type narrowing is refining types to more specific ones using type guards. Methods: 1) typeof checks, 2) instanceof, 3) in operator, 4) Custom type guards with 'is'. Example: if (typeof x === 'string') { x.toUpperCase(); } TypeScript knows x is string inside the block.",

      "tags": ["type-guards", "narrowing"]
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What are mapped types in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Mapped types create new types by transforming properties of existing types. Syntax: { [K in keyof T]: NewType }. Example: type Readonly<T> = { readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K]; }. Useful for creating variations like making all properties optional, readonly, or nullable.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "tags": ["mapped-types", "advanced"]
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Explain the 'readonly' modifier in TypeScript.",
      "answer": "readonly makes properties immutable after initialization. Can be used on: 1) Interface/type properties, 2) Array (ReadonlyArray<T>), 3) Class properties. Example: interface Point { readonly x: number; } Once set, x cannot be changed. Use for immutability and preventing accidental modifications.",

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the difference between 'const' and 'readonly'?",
      "answer": "const - for variables, prevents reassignment. readonly - for properties, prevents modification after initialization. const x = [1,2]; x.push(3); // OK. interface Props { readonly items: number[]; } props.items.push(3); // Error. Use const for variables, readonly for object properties.",
